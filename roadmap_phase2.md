Bookmark Locker App: Next Steps & Enhancements Checklist

This checklist outlines the features and bug fixes you've identified as next steps for your Kotlin Android Bookmark Locker app.

General Instructions for AI:

    Focus on one task at a time. Report completion of each sub-task before moving to the next.

    Provide the full updated code for any file you modify. Do not provide snippets.

    Explain your changes clearly in your response.

    Prioritize robust, idiomatic Kotlin and Android best practices.

    For verification steps, describe how you would manually test the feature.

1. Option for User to Pick Their Own Ringtone

    Goal: Allow users to select a custom sound file from their device for reminder notifications.

    Tasks:

        [ ] Task 1.1: Implement Ringtone Picker Launch.

            In your app's Settings screen, add an option (e.g., a clickable preference item) to "Choose Reminder Sound."

            When clicked, launch an Intent using Intent.ACTION_RINGTONE_PICKER to open the system's ringtone picker.

            Ensure you handle the result of this Intent in onActivityResult (for older APIs) or registerForActivityResult (for modern APIs) to get the selected Uri.

        [ ] Task 1.2: Store Selected Ringtone URI.

            Save the Uri of the chosen ringtone (as a String) in your app's SharedPreferences or Room database (if you have a settings entity).

        [ ] Task 1.3: Use Custom Ringtone for Reminders.

            Modify your reminder notification logic (in your BroadcastReceiver or Service) to use the stored Uri when building the Notification.

            If no custom ringtone is selected, fall back to your default custom ringtone (R.raw.my_reminder_sound) or the system default.

    Verification (Manual Testing):

        Go to Settings > Choose Reminder Sound.

        Select a system sound or a sound from your device.

        Set a reminder for a bookmark.

        Verify that the reminder notification plays the newly selected custom ringtone.

        Try selecting "None" or "Silent" if the picker allows, and verify no sound plays (or it falls back to silent).

2. Custom Snooze Date/Time in Settings

    Goal: Provide users with more control over snooze durations for reminders.

    Tasks:

        [ ] Task 2.1: Implement Snooze Duration Settings UI.

            In your app's Settings screen, add Reminders with options for customizable snooze durations (e.g., "Snooze for 5 minutes," "Snooze for 15 minutes," "Snooze for 1 hour," or even a custom input field).

            Store the user's preferred default snooze duration (e.g., in milliseconds) in SharedPreferences.

        [ ] Task 2.2: Update Snooze Action Logic.

            Modify the "Snooze Reminder" action in your notification's BroadcastReceiver or Service.

            When the "Snooze" button is tapped, retrieve the user's preferred snooze duration from SharedPreferences.

            Reschedule the AlarmManager using this custom duration.

    Verification (Manual Testing):

        Go to Settings and set a custom snooze duration (e.g., 2 minutes for testing).

        Set a reminder for a bookmark.

        When the reminder fires, tap "Snooze."

        Verify that the reminder reappears after the custom snooze duration you set in settings.

        Try changing the snooze duration in settings and re-testing.

3. Back Gesture for Settings to Return to Main Tabs

    Goal: Ensure the back gesture (or hardware back button) from the Settings screen navigates back to the main tabs (Bookmarks, Favorites, Reading List, Folders) instead of exiting the app.

    Tasks:

        [ ] Task 3.1: Review Settings Activity/Fragment Navigation.

            Identify how your Settings screen is launched (e.g., startActivity from the main Activity or using AndroidX Navigation Component).

            If it's a separate Activity, ensure that when it's launched, it's not clearing the task stack in a way that prevents returning to the main Activity.

            If it's a Fragment within your main Activity, ensure that the FragmentManager is handling the back stack correctly.

        [ ] Task 3.2: Override onBackPressedDispatcher (if necessary).

            If the default back behavior is exiting the app, you might need to override onBackPressedDispatcher.addCallback in your Settings Activity or Fragment.

            The logic should check if there's a back stack to pop (e.g., if it's a nested fragment) or simply finish() the Settings Activity to return to the previous Activity on the stack (which should be your main one).

            Important: If using AndroidX Navigation Component, this is often handled automatically if your navigation graph is set up correctly.

    Verification (Manual Testing):

        Navigate to your main Bookmarks list.

        Go to Settings.

        Use the system back gesture (swipe from edge) or tap the hardware back button.

        Verify that you return to the Bookmarks list (or whichever tab was active) and the app does not exit.

        Test this from different main tabs (e.g., go to Favorites, then Settings, then back).
